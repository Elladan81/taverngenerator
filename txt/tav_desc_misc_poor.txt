the tables are strewn with empty mugs and plates
the walls are adorned with the skulls of hunted creatures
the paint is peeling from the walls
the smell of smoke lingers in the air
the smell of cooked food pervades.
the floor is stick with grime and mud
the floor is swept clean
the floor is damp
a large club hangs above the bar
a large sword hangs above the bar
a large axe hangs above the bar
the tables are close and crowded together around the fire
the tables are old and battered
the tables are old, but clean
the table is two long communal benches with seats attached
small tables are spead haphazardly around the bar
the tables are large but few and force strangers to share
heraldry of the local nobles is displayed around the bar
ancient heraldry is hung around the bar
farm tools are stacked in the corners of the bar
large crates and barrels are stacked around the bar
