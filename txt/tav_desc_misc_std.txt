the walls are freshly painted
the walls are batterd with scratches and chips
small tables are scatter haphazardly around the bar
large tables are set at regular spaces around the bar
the smell of pipesmoke lingers in the air
the smell of peat lingers in the air
the smell of food cooking pervades the air
the smell of incense chokes the air
the floor has cracks and chips
the floor is paved stone
the floor is clay tiles
the tables are old and battered
the tables are worn, but finely crafted
the tables are new and recently made
there are several comfortable chairs by the hearth
the bar is stone topped, and intricately detailed
the heraldry of local nobles is displayed around the bar
